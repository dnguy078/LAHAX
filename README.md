LA Hacks 2015 

Inspired in part by the soulsigns mechanic in Dark Souls and in part by YikYak, this project is a mobile app that is intended to allow users to leave messages that are tied to a particular geolocation. Some messages can be viewed remotely within a limited proximity of the user's current location, while others are "secret" and only become visible when the user is close-by. Message persist for a limited amount of time, but their lifetime can be extended by positive feedback. The secret message feature is designed to provide the user with a real-life version of the experience of the Dark Souls soulsigns mechanic while the public messages mechanic allows the user to browse nearby activity without a great demand for physical exploration.

Possible uses: geocaching, tourism, food truck notifications, campus nerfwar/humansversuszombies games.
